[![Hourly update](https://github.com/t11z/pan-edl/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/t11z/pan-edl/actions/workflows/main.yml)

External Dynamic Lists that can be consumed by Palo Alto Networks firewalls

## How to add it to your Palo Alto Networks firewall

1. Download GitHub Intermediate- and Root CA certificates 
2. Import certificates into your firewall (Device -> Certificate Management -> Certificates -> Import)
3. Create Certificate Profile in your firewall (Device -> Certificate Management -> Certificate Profile)
4. Choose a name and add intermediate and root CA certificates to the Certificate Profile
5. Add External Dynamic List object according to your needs (Objects -> External Dynamic Lists -> Add) and select the Certificate Profile you have just created
6. Choose an EDL from the list below, add it to the input box and click on "OK"
7. Commit your configuration

**Important**: The firewall will only download the list, if you use it in your rulebase. If the list is not used in the rulebase, it is expected behavior that the list remains empty.
